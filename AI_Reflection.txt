AIs used: Chatgpt, Vercel
=> Chatgpt hallucinates or mixes up different approaches that do not work
    prompting needs to be  more precise
=> Vercel is usually more reliable

Day-1:

initiated project with vite + react + tailwind
first of all the was confusion because chatgpt led me on the wrong path!
Then I discovered the correct way to implemente tailwind in vite
https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite

I asked chatgpt to create me a small plan on what to do for starters
+ wanted it to give me a pdf from its cnversation with me 
Result: It was horrible

I googled for possible google chrome extension that would do the same thing
and the result was as I would have originally expected!
