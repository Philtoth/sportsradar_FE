AIs used: Chatgpt, Vercel
=> Chatgpt hallucinates or mixes up different approaches that do not work
    prompting needs to be  more precise
=> Vercel is usually more reliable

Day-1:

initiated project with vite + react + tailwind
first of all the was confusion because chatgpt led me on the wrong path!
Then I discovered the correct way to implement tailwind in vite
https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite

I asked chatgpt to create me a small plan on what to do for starters
+ wanted it to give me a pdf from its cnversation with me 
Result: It was horrible

I googled for possible google chrome extension that would do the same thing
and the result was as I would have originally expected!

I was not really satisfied with the approaches
I will try checking out different libraries !

Resorted back to React , created my diploma project with it , were my first steps into the js/programming-world

Day-2:
I create my project-template from Day-1 into more functional working site (Task 4 not optimized yet)
I will cover styling with tailwind rather at the end I just want the logic to be done
Tackled Task 1 & 2 fully
Tackling Task 3 => currently form data (=details page data) 
    Maybe asking chatgpt how to adapt react-components state

Day 3: 
fixed sessionstorage + added date dynamic effects / states
combined data into a single object instead of mutation
fixed detailpage-view on newly added components

Day 4:
asked styling related questions , it helped a ton, even if sometimes it was just a typo
explained tailwind mediabreakpoints very well => misunderstanding previously
showed me react-icons
helped for deciding on a some color-scheme that harmonizes
